## 4. Mountain Bikes: Ship vs. Buy New

You have two high-quality mountain bikes: a Specialized Chisel and a Rocky Mountain Altitude. Here’s a comparison of the costs involved.

| Option | Details | Estimated Cost (AUD) | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ship from Mexico** | Requires professional packing and international shipping. Risks include potential damage and customs/biosecurity inspection fees in Australia. | **$1,500 - $3,000** | This is the most **cost-effective** option, especially since you already own the bikes and they are high-value. Ensure they are professionally cleaned and packed to minimize biosecurity risks. |
| **Buy New in Australia** | Selling your current bikes in Mexico and buying equivalent new models in Melbourne. | **$8,000 - $12,000+** | A new Specialized Chisel costs ~$3,000-$4,000. A new Rocky Mountain Altitude costs ~$5,000-$8,000+. This is a significantly more expensive option. |
