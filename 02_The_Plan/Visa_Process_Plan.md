# Visa Process Plan: Subclass 482

This document details the specific steps, timeline, and required documentation for the family's Skills in Demand (Subclass 482) visa application.

---

### **Overview: The 3 Stages of the 482 Visa**

The Subclass 482 visa process consists of three main stages. Bundle of Rays (BoR) is responsible for the first two, and you are responsible for the third.

1.  **Stage 1: Standard Business Sponsorship (SBS)**
    *   **Who:** Bundle of Rays
    *   **What:** BoR must apply to the Department of Home Affairs to become an approved sponsor. This allows them to sponsor skilled workers from overseas. This approval is usually valid for 5 years.

2.  **Stage 2: Nomination**
    *   **Who:** Bundle of Rays
    *   **What:** Once BoR is an approved sponsor, they must nominate the specific role they want you to fill (CTO). They have to prove that it's a genuine position, meets a minimum salary threshold, and that they've tested the local market if required.

3.  **Stage 3: Visa Application**
    *   **Who:** Hector & Family
    *   **What:** Once the nomination is approved, you and your family can formally apply for your visas. This is where you provide your skills assessment, English test results, identity documents, and undergo health and character checks.
