### **Plan B: Alternative Schools**

Having a Plan B is crucial. If the VCASS application is unsuccessful, here are excellent alternative schools with strong drama/theatre programs that accept international students.

| School | Location | Why it's a good alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Williamstown High School** | Williamstown | Has a well-established international student program and strong encouragement for participation in extracurricular arts and drama. |
| **Kew High School** | Kew | A performance-oriented school with a dedicated theatre and a strong support network for international students. |
| **Sandringham College** | Sandringham | A co-educational school with a vibrant performing arts program, an on-site English Language Centre, and year-round applications. |

### **Plan B Admission Process & Timeline**

The process for these schools is different from VCASS and offers more flexibility.

*   **No Audition Required:** Admission is not based on a competitive audition. It is based on academic merit, English language proficiency, and place availability.
*   **Centralized Application:** You do not apply to the schools directly. You apply through the central government portal, **Study Victoria** ([https://www.study.vic.gov.au/](https://www.study.vic.gov.au/)). On the application, you can list your preferred schools.
*   **Mid-Year Intake (July 2026):** A major advantage is that these schools accept mid-year enrolments for **Semester 2**, which starts in July. This means Natalia could apply in early 2026 and potentially start school very soon after arriving in Melbourne.
*   **Requirements:** You will generally need:
    *   Recent school reports (translated).
    *   Proof of English proficiency (an IELTS test may be required).
    *   Your valid visa (once granted).

**Recommendation:** You can prepare an application for the Plan B schools in parallel. The ideal time to submit an application through the Study Victoria portal for a July 2026 start would be around **March-April 2026**, once your visa has been lodged.
