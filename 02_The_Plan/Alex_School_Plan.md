### **Action Plan for Enrolment**

The enrolment process for Alex will happen **after** we arrive in Melbourne and have secured a long-term rental property.

*   **Timeline:** July 2026 (Weeks 2-3 after arrival).
*   **Goal:** Enrol Alex to start Term 3 (mid-July) of the 2026 school year.

#### **Steps:**

1.  **[ ] Secure Long-Term Housing (July, Week 2-3):**
    *   Once we have a signed lease agreement, we will have a permanent address, which determines our local school "zone".

2.  **[ ] Contact the Local School (July, Week 2-3):**
    *   We will contact the secondary school for which we are zoned based on our new address.
    *   We will inquire about their enrolment process for a dependent on a 482 visa.

3.  **[ ] Submit Application via Study Victoria (if required):**
    *   While many dependents can enrol directly, some schools may require us to submit an application via the central **Study Victoria** portal. We will follow the school's guidance.
    *   **Link:** [https://www.study.vic.gov.au/](https://www.study.vic.gov.au/)

4.  **[ ] Prepare Documents (July, Week 2-3):**
    *   We will have these documents ready in digital format:
        *   Alex's Passport & Visa Grant Notice
        *   Translated Birth Certificate
        *   Translated School Reports from Colegio Humboldt
        *   Proof of Melbourne residential address (lease agreement)

5.  **[ ] Attend Enrolment Meeting (July, Week 3-4):**
    *   The school will likely schedule a meeting to finalize the enrolment, discuss subject selection, and provide information on uniforms and booklists.
