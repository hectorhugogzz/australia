# Moving, Shipping, and Furnishing

## Shipping from Mexico to Australia
*   **Sea Freight:**
    *   **Cost:** More economical. A 20-foot container is estimated around ~$12,400 USD; a 40-foot container at ~$23,500 USD. Shared containers (LCL) are an option for smaller volumes.
    *   **Timeline:** Several weeks.
*   **Air Freight:**
    *   **Cost:** Significantly more expensive, charged per kilogram.
    *   **Timeline:** 2-4 business days. Best for urgent or high-value items.
*   **Customs and Biosecurity:**
    *   Used household goods owned for 12+ months can generally be imported duty-free.
    *   An "Unaccompanied Personal Effects Statement (B534 Form)" is required.
    *   Australia has very strict biosecurity laws. All items are inspected, and items like wooden furniture may require treatment at your expense.

## Furnishing a House in Melbourne
*   **Decision:** Given the high cost of shipping, potential biosecurity issues, and the need to buy several new items anyway, it is **likely more cost-effective to sell most current belongings and buy new/second-hand in Melbourne**. This avoids logistical complexity and allows you to choose items that fit your new home.
*   **Estimated Furnishing Costs (3-4 Bedroom House):**
    *   **New (Overall):** Can range from a basic AUD $16,000 - $32,000 up to AUD $70,000+ for average quality items.
    *   **New Appliances:** Essential kitchen appliances can cost AUD $5,000 - $15,000.
    *   **Second-Hand:** A great way to save money. Options include thrift stores, online marketplaces (Facebook Marketplace), auction houses, and factory-second appliance stores (often with warranties).
