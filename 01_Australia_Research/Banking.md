# Banking in Australia for New Arrivals

*   **How to Open a Bank Account:**
    *   **Choose a Bank:** Major banks include Commonwealth Bank (CommBank), Westpac, NAB, and ANZ. It's recommended to research their specific accounts for new migrants.
    *   **Opening Before Arrival (Recommended):**
        *   **CommBank & Westpac** allow you to start the application process online up to 14 days (or even 3 months) before you arrive. This is highly beneficial for transferring funds ahead of time.
        *   **NAB & ANZ** typically require you to be in Australia to open an account.
*   **Required Documents:**
    *   Valid Passport (as primary ID)
    *   Valid Visa / Proof of Residency
    *   Tax Identification Number (TIN) from your country of tax residency (Mexico)
    *   An Australian residential address (you will need to provide this eventually)
    *   An Australian mobile number
*   **Application Process:**
    1.  Complete the online application (if opening from overseas).
    2.  Upon arrival in Melbourne, visit a branch of your chosen bank.
    3.  Verify your identity in person with your original passport and visa documents.
    4.  Activate your account, set up internet banking, and collect your debit card.
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   **Fund Transfers:** Due to regulations, you may not be able to deposit funds until the account is verified in person. Services like Wise (formerly TransferWise) or XE can be useful for the initial transfer.
    *   **Tax File Number (TFN):** You can open the account without an Australian TFN, but you should provide one to the bank later to avoid paying a higher tax rate on any interest earned.
    *   **No Minimum Deposit:** Most newcomer accounts do not require an initial minimum deposit.
