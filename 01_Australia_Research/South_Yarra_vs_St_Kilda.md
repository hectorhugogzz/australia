## Housing & Real Estate Snapshot

### Housing Security: Townhouse/Unit vs. House

Generally, **townhouses and apartments (units) are considered more secure than standalone houses**. This is due to:
*   **Proximity to Neighbors:** More "eyes on the street" and shared walls can deter criminals.
*   **Fewer Entry Points:** Less external exposure compared to a house with a yard on all sides.
*   **Managed Security:** Many modern apartment complexes have secure single-point entry, key-fob access, and CCTV.

Regardless of the property type, investing in good quality locks, an alarm system, and adequate lighting is recommended.
