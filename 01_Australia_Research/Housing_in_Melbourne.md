## Note on South Yarra and Southbank
These suburbs were not on the initial list because the focus was on areas with a higher prevalence of family houses with yards. However, they are excellent choices if you prefer a more urban, apartment-style living environment. They are very close to the Arts Precinct and offer a high level of amenities, restaurants, and direct access to the city's cultural life.
