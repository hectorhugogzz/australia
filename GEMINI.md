# Meta-Prompt for Planning a Move from Puebla, Mexico to Melbourne, Australia

This document will serve as our guide for creating a comprehensive, step-by-step plan for your move. We will use this as a "meta-prompt" to keep track of our progress and ensure all your questions are answered.

Our goal is to create a detailed, month-by-month (and eventually week-by-week) plan. We will break down the process into manageable steps, addressing all your unknowns.

## The Plan

We have now addressed all the initial topics and gathered comprehensive information for each:

1.  **Visa Process:** Covered in detail.
2.  **Cost of Living:** Estimated monthly budget and breakdowns provided.
3.  **Housing:** Preferred neighborhoods, rental prices, and initial requirements researched.
4.  **Schooling:** VCASS details, Alex's schooling options, and general enrollment process/fees covered.
5.  **Transportation:** Public transport system, driving regulations, and car ownership costs researched.
6.  **Moving & Belongings:** Shipping logistics, costs, and a recommendation on shipping vs. buying new provided.
7.  **Banking:** How to open an account and pre-arrival options covered.
8.  **Travel:** Estimated flight costs and best booking times researched.
9.  **Initial Settling-in Period:** Key tasks and a realistic budget outlined.

## Our Process

All initial information gathering is complete, and the detailed findings have been synthesized into the `CONTEXT.md` file, which now serves as our single source of truth.

**Next Step:** We will refine the `02_The_Plan/Move_Plan.md` by breaking down the monthly tasks into a more granular, week-by-week schedule where appropriate. This will make the plan more actionable and easier to track.
