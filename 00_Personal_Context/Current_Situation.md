## Rental & Furnishing Strategy in Melbourne
*   **Dilemma:** The family is deciding between renting a furnished property initially (like an Airbnb) or immediately seeking an unfurnished long-term rental and buying furniture.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the number of specific items that need to be purchased anyway, the most straightforward approach appears to be: **Sell bulky items in Mexico, find a long-term unfurnished rental in Melbourne, and buy new/second-hand items upon arrival.** This provides the most control over setting up the new home to your specific needs.
